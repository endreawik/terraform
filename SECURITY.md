# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project will contain scripts, and the newest version will be in the main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This document describs how to report a security vulnerability privately to give the project time to address the problem before a public disclosure.

The main idea:

* You have information about a security problem
* You want the problem fixed before a public disclosure

To report a problem:

* Send an email to security at endreawik.com with the details about the security problem

Please refer to the CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, (SPECIAL REPORT CMU/SEI-2017-SR-022) for additional considerations.
